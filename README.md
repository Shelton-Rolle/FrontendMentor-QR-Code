## My process

I started approaching this project by looking at how I think the project should be set up in html. I noticed we would need a card, that contained an image and text, so I concluded we could use a card div that contained an image and a div with some content.

After deciding on my approach, I created my main.css file which I would be using for styling. I added some boiler plate css and some root variables that contained the values listed in the style-guide provided.

With my css set up, I began adding in the html I had planned, and styled everything accordingly with css.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
